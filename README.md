# TextScanner

TextScanner is a tool that helps you to easily catalog and manage your Apple devices. With the help of Apple's VisionKit framework, you can quickly scan the serial numbers and model numbers of your devices and compare them against a given dataset. The tool is highly customizable and allows you to configure custom actions and fields to fit your needs.

**Note:** This tool requires a device that has the neural engine, such as the iPhone 13 or newer.
